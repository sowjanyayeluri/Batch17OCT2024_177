WHAT IS CHAR *
ARRAYS ARE WORK AS A POINTER LIKE
int display(int [] or int *); //declare
int diplay(int arr[] or int *arr) //defination
display(a[] or a) //main
the memory will be allocated in bottom to top manner like if int a;
										 int b;
then b has lower address and a has the higher address
arrays works on formula BA+(indexvalue*sizeof(dt))
four types of arrays:
1. static array: size is known before the compilation time
2. dynamic array: size of array is given at the run time by malloc, calloc, realloc contain in stdlib.h library
3. strechable array: size of array are increased or decreased depending on need for dynamic array
4. mutable array: size of array is known at the time of linking and before execution using extern keyword
functions:
1. std lib functions
2. user defined function
and
1. witharguments
2.without arguments
3. with return type
int add(int,int); args named can be avoided, ; indicates their no body of the prototype.

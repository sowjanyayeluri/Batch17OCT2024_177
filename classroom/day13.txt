Unions:
the only diifernce is we can able to access only one element at a time.
just after allocating value u need to call it. 
Enums
FILE HANDLING:
we use SOF and EOF to start and end of file.
FILE data structure or typedefined name for files.
two types:
1.sequential file
2.randm access file
to open file fopen(filename,modofaccess) modes r,w,rw,append. fopen return file pointer if file exits if not returns null
fprintf,fscanf are formatted wrinting and reading.
fgets,fputs are unformatted i/o operation
fwrite/fread are reading and writing binary objects
Question:
Allocate the size based on no of records in file.
by using system function we cant execute system commands.
ftell(fd) say the cursor position
fseek(fd,bytes to move,(SEET_SET OR SEEK_CUR OR SEEK_END) if u used apart from this this gives EINVALID error) set the cursor position it not give error if it is end of the file
rewind(fd) set file pointer to beginning of the file
fread() to read from file return no of bytes read
fwrite() to write into file in binary formt return no of bytes written 

Typedef Struct EMP

{

Int id;

Float sal;

Char g;

Char Name[20];

}sEMP;


Typedef Union uEmployee

{

Int id;

int sal;

Char g;

Char Name[20];

}uEMP;


Int main()

{

sEMP es;

uEMP eu;

Printf(“\n size of union = %d”,sizeof(eu));

Printf(“\n size of structure = %d”,sizeof(es));

Printf(“\n\n”);


eu.id = 101;

eu.sal= 10000

printf(“\n%d”,eu.id); /// Here the sal is overridden and the output is 10000


eu.id = 101;

eu.sal= 10000;

strcpy(eu.Name,”Bhima”);

printf(“\n%d”,eu.id) /// Here it prints the ascii values



eu1= (uEMP *)malloc(sizeof(uEMP));

eu1 ->id = 102;

printf(“%d”,eu1->id);



Enum enum-type-name

{

Enumeration list

}variable_list;


E.g.:

Enum daysOfWeek

{

Monday=1000, Tuesday,Wednesday,

Thursday=4005, Friday, Saturday,

Sunday

} Days;


Int main()

{


Days=Monday;

Printf(“\n Day= %d”,Days);


Return0;

}

Enum RegClrCodes

{

Black, Brown, Red, Orange,

Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Gray, White

} RCC;


int main()

{

Scanf(“%d”,&n);

Switch(n)

{

Case Black: printf(“Black);

Break;

Case Brown: printf(“Brown”);

Break;

}

}

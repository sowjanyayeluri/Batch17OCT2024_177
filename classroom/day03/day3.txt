changing the file permissions in unix:
- chmod to change permission of file or directory only owners and superusers
- 1-execute
- 2-write
- 4-read
- w-write
- o-others
- all at a time 0xxx(0 is special bit even it word without 0) file or directory name
- chown newusername filename
in switch case:
how switch is internally operated-> it converts into numeric and search like binary search
IMPORTANT

- .so or .a files are library files
- .a are static libraries 
- .so are shared libraries
- dlopen dynamic libraries
shared liabraries are no embedded into the excutable but loaded at runtimes
